# Part-IV

The problem statement and the tutorial for Part IV of the  course is given [here](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~david/courses/cs752/Fall2015/wiki/index.php?n=Main.Homework4)

## Usage

1. Simply use gcc/g++ compiler to check the results.
```shell
$ g++ choose.cpp
$ time ./a.out
```

2. Similar to the previous parts use the `Makefile` to create a static binary file of the program (already included). Change the test bench in `sieve_config.py` file to the directory that contains the static binary. Build the CPU. See the difference in performance in the files `/m5out/stats.txt` and other performance files. 

3. Need to fix `m5op.h` problems in Part-III to complete this.
